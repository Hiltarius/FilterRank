The project entitled Tiny Image in JavaScript — TIJ — is a small toolbox of image processing functions written in JavaScript and using graphics acceleration via WebGL.

# 1-Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop one or more image processing features in a classical image toolbox. This is also the opportunity to enhance your skills in JavaScript programming and to see other paradigms (here, functional programming)

The timeline of this project is as follows:

1. First month is focused on literature search and presentation of the algorithms with the various optimizations.
2. Second month consists of the development of one or more functions in vanilla JavaScript — the last version will be used ECMAScript 2015 or ECMAScript 6 — using the paradigm of functional programming.
3. Third month is dedicated to the implementation of the same functions but using WebGL library. 
At each step, benchmarking is done and the results are explained in the manuscript in the Results section.

# 2-Manuscrit

## 2-1- Content

The manuscript must contain the conventional scientific sections comprising:
* Introduction
* Material & Methods
* Results
* Discussion
* Conclusion
* References

## 2-2- Notes

* Material & Methods contains at minima the description of the algorithms.
* Results contains some examples of the image processing and a benchmark of the features you have to study. This benchmark is important —   specially for the second and third months — to explore the low-level operations of your function(s).
* Discussion contains a comparison of various implementations, possible improvements, etc.
  In the References section, only the scientific articles/books will be accepted. No link to web site, for example, are authorized.

The manuscript must be written in plain english using the extended version — github.io addons — of the markdown language. Then, this source must be converted in PDF using your own favorite tool and deposited in the moodle.

### Note: In parallel of the PDF, the source files will be deposited in the moodle as a zip file containing the markdown file and a directory entitlted img containing the images of the figures.
