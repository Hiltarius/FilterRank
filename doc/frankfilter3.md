# 1.Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since image have been digitized on a computer's memory, it has been possible to interact in new ways with those images that were otherwise impossible. This is called image proccessing, and it consist of methods used to perform operations on a digital image. Those methods are described with various algorithms that can be used for various purposes in multiple fields. Those applications are used for noise filtering and other image enhancement as well as extracting information from images. In this project, will be examined the algorithms used for three types of 2D rank filters : median, min&max and variance.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;  By definition rank filters are non-linear filters using the local gray-level ordering to compute the filtered value[^Soi2002] . The output of the filter is the pixel value selected from a specified position in this ranked list. The ranked list is represented by all the grey values that lies within the window which are sorted, from the smallest to the highest value.
For an identical window the pixel value will differ in function of the filters used (median, min, max and variance). Moreover the size of the window is also influencing the output pixel. 
The variance filter is used to edge detection. Edges can be detected using the 1st (Sobel or Cany approaches[^Can1986][^Kit1983]) or 2nd deriviates(Log approach[^Mar1980]) of the grey level intensity. Nevertheless there's other alternatives using synthetic and real images with the variance filter[^Fab2011] or simply with a simple formula. The three filters have their own field of expertise. They can be used for removing noise (median filter), detecting edge (variance filter) and mathematical morphology(min/max filters). The main issues of these filters algorithm are their slowness, to overcome these problems the use of small windows and/or low resolution images is required[^Wei2006]. The last part of this project include an implementation of our algorithm with Webgl[!cite] in order to highly increase the performance of the agorithm while using gpu.


&nbsp;&nbsp;  In this report, we shall begin by describing the main algorithm with the cpu and then explain how to implement it in webgl . 
* Variance filter

Next step will be to perform a benchmark on different imageJ plugins, with the objective of comparing their performances such as execution time and the memory load for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The ImageJ plugins compared are the default ImageJ RankFilters plugin which has implementation for the median, maximum, minimum and variance filters.

## Implementation of the variance filter

## Variance filter

In image processing, variance filter is often used for highlighting edges in the image by replacing each pixel with the neighbourhood variance. 

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/computational.png)
##### Equation_1: Variance filter is computed here by substracting the sum of the pixel square with two times the sum divided by the number of pixels in the kernel and overall divided by the number of pixels - 1.


This filter is implemented in imageJ through the class rankfilters in java. For variance algorithm, according to the input image and the size of the kernel, it will not react in the same way. If the kernel’s radius size is less than 2 (5x5), it will compute the sum over all the pixels, whereas for a kernel’s radius size greater than 2, the sum won’t be calculated. In that case this sum is calculated for the first pixel of every line only. For the following pixels, it’ll add the new values and subtract those that are not in the sum any more. This way, the computational time is then reduced. Once, the kernel reaches the end of the thread, it start over at the next line until the end of the input image. It’s notable that the variance algorithm is closely related to the mean algorithm. 
&nbsp;In application, this algorithm works by using one “window” defined here by a circular kernel, which slides, entry by entry until the end of the signal. It can process through rows or columns.
This method is simple, moreover it’s characterised by low computational complexity compared to other methods (Cany, Sobel).
However it’s not devoid of weakness because of its low resistance to noise. Indeed the impulse and Gaussian noise significantly decreases quality of edge detection [^Fab2011].

### Choice of algorithm for webgl implementation

The naive algorithm is used for computing the variance with the convolve and also for the webgl implementation. The main reason to use this algorithm is that it can be computed in one pass. The method with the convolve was implemented by JC Taveau, while I implemented an other method based on integral image[!cite  Grzegorz Sarwas
and Sławomir Skoneczny, Object Localization and Detection Using Variance Filter] these algorithms are running only with the CPU. However, the previous method is not that performant as described in the benchmark and it's rather difficult to implement it in webgl. Hence, the one pass algorithm was picked mainly for the performance and it's the same algorithm that in ImageJ.

### Webgl implementation


## Benchmarking analysis
Benchmarking analysis is a method widely used to assess the relative performance of an object[^Fle1896]. That way, it's possible to compare the performance of various algorithms. Only execution time and memory load will be analysed here. In order to perform this benchmark, one script was implemented. The first script, named *benchmark2* whose aim is to compute the time speed between the start and the end of an input image coming from ImageJ during the filtering process. This script was implemented using the ImageJ macro language. 
The operation process is run 1000 times for ImageJ measurements to provide robust data. In order to not recording false values we're not considering the first 100 values. Indeed during the execution, we must take into account the internal allocations of the loading images which may introduce error in our measurement. For our own algorithm we did only 50 iterations because of the amount of time that each algorithm takes.

For this project the benchmark was performed with the operating system Linux (4.9.0-3-amd64)  using the 1.8.0_144 version of Java and running with the 1.51q version of ImageJ. The model image of this benchmark is Lena for various pixels size.

### Variance filter 

The following figure shows the result of our _variance_ function for a boat of 720x576 pixels taking as parameter a kernel of diameter = 3 compared to the variance filter of ImageJ with a kernel radius = 1. The results are different for mainly two reasons one is that the luminosity between B and C are different and the fact that the kernel on ImageJ is circular whereas our kernel is square.

Moreover, we obtain the same result between the GPU and CPU based on the substraction that's logic because the variance is computed with the same algorithm.

## Benchmark comparison between ImageJ, CPU and GPU

### Variance filter

A comparative benchmark for our own  Variance filter against the Variance filter from imageJ has been done with a set of 24 images bewteen seven different resolution  360x288, 720x576, 900x720, 1080x864, 1440x1152, 1880x1440 and 2880x2304. Each set of 3 images have the same resolution but with a different type, either 8bit, 16bit or float32. The benchmark representation is represented down below :
	
![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/plotplot.png)
#### Fig 15. Execution time benchmark analysis against the implemented variance algorithm for a kernel size = 3, filter = Variance. 
On the figure 15, the execution time for either 8bit,16bit or float32 for an image with the same resolution does not change significantly on either resolution, infact the 3 lines which represent the execution time are close together. For the first 6 resolutions we can see an increase of the execution time from 50ms in general up to 4500 ms. At a resolution of 1880x1440 and higher the line follows an exponential pattern, this is where we find our algorithm limit. Finally our algorithm has the same performance for either 8bit,16bit or float32.

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/plotij.png) 
#### Fig 16. Execution time benchmark analysis against the variance algorithm of ImageJ for a kernel size = 3, filter = Variance. 
On the figure 16, the execution time from the first resolution to the sixth doesnt change really, also the scale of the benchamrk isnt the same, in fact the imageJ algorithm is way much more efficient than our own implementation. For the first image with a resolution of 360x288 our algorithm takes 50ms to complete the process unlike imageJ algorithm which takes 1.398ms. When we use the algorithm on all the upsizing images ImageJ algorithm execution time doesn't go higher than 80ms for either 16bit or 32bit when on the contrary our own algorithm goes until 20000ms for the 2880x2304 resolution. We also see that the variance imageJ algorithm execution time change between images types. Indeed it takes around 80ms for 16 bit and 32bit against 45ms for 8bit, it's two times faster for filtering an 8bit image compared to 16bit and 32bit whereas there's no particular changes for our function. Moreover 8bit filter is way more faster than for the two other types mainly because of the low complexity values [0...256].

# 4.Discussion
## Overall quality comparison between imageJ, CPU and GPU for the variance filter.

## Overall performance comparison between imageJ, CPU and GPU for the variance filter.

# 5.Conclusion
In general, the execution time of every algorithm implemented are slower than the ImageJ  especially for high resolution images. The min_max and median algorithm have higher exexution time than the variance algorithm, however we do obtain close results for the similarity of the output images for each algorithm.
For each algorithm we did try to functionalize as much as we could, and curried our functions delivering  fonctional algorithms which work with 8 bit,16bit and float32 images
Finally the different algorithms respect what was developped in the first markdown for instance the min_max algorithm respects the process of 1D filter after 1D filter described in the first markdown, and the variance algorithm respects the algorithm proposed to calculate the variance of an image. On the other hand, the median filter has been implemented using a naive algorithm because the attempted implementation of the Huang algorithm ended more time consuming.
