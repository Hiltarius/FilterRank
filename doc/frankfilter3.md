# 1.Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since image have been digitized on a computer's memory, it has been possible to interact in new ways with those images that were otherwise impossible. This is called image proccessing, and it consist of methods used to perform operations on a digital image. Those methods are described with various algorithms that can be used for various purposes in multiple fields. Those applications are used for noise filtering and other image enhancement as well as extracting information from images. In this project, will be examined the algorithms used for three types of 2D rank filters : median, min&max and variance.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;  By definition rank filters are non-linear filters using the local gray-level ordering to compute the filtered value[^Soi2002] . The output of the filter is the pixel value selected from a specified position in this ranked list. The ranked list is represented by all the grey values that lies within the window which are sorted, from the smallest to the highest value.
For an identical window the pixel value will differ in function of the filters used (median, min, max and variance). Moreover the size of the window is also influencing the output pixel. 
The median filter is so called because it's an operation which selects the median value.The median filter has been suggested by Tukey[^Tuk1974]. This filter is widely used for reducing certain type of noise and periodic interference patterns in signal and images without severly degrading the signal[^Hua1981].The naive algorithm was then improved based on the moving histogram technique[^Hua1979].
The filter that chooses the maximum or minimum values is called the maximum filter or the minimum filter. In discrete mathematical morphology, the minimum and maximum ranks play a key role since they correspond to the fundamental erosion and dilation operators[^Soi2002][^Wer1985]. Lastly the variance filter is used to edge detection. Edges can be detected using the 1st (Sobel or Cany approaches[^Can1986][^Kit1983]) or 2nd deriviates(Log approach[^Mar1980]) of the grey level intensity. Nevertheless there's other alternatives using synthetic and real images with the variance filter[^Fab2011]. As demonstrated here our three main filters have their own field of expertise. They can be used for removing noise (median filter), detecting edge (variance filter) and mathematical morphology(min/max filters). The main issues of these filters algorithm are their slowness, to overcome these problems the use of small windows and/or low resolution images is required[^Wei2006]. Morover, the last part of this project include an implementation of our algorithm with Webgl[!cite] in order to highly increase the performance of the agorithm while using gpu.


&nbsp;&nbsp;  In this report, we shall begin by describing the main algorithm with the cpu and then explain how to implement it in webgl . 
* Variance filter

Next step will be to perform a benchmark on different imageJ plugins, with the objective of comparing their performances such as execution time and the memory load for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The ImageJ plugins compared are the default ImageJ RankFilters plugin which has implementation for the median, maximum, minimum and variance filters.

## Implementation of the variance filter

## Variance filter

In image processing, variance filter is often used for highlighting edges in the image by replacing each pixel with the neighbourhood variance.

##### Equation_1: Variance filter is computed here by substracting the sum of the pixel square with two times the sum divided by the number of pixels in the kernel and overall divided by the number of pixels - 1.


This filter is implemented in imageJ through the class rankfilters in java. For variance algorithm, according to the input image and the size of the kernel, it will not react in the same way. If the kernel’s radius size is less than 2 (5x5), it will compute the sum over all the pixels, whereas for a kernel’s radius size greater than 2, the sum won’t be calculated. In that case this sum is calculated for the first pixel of every line only. For the following pixels, it’ll add the new values and subtract those that are not in the sum any more. This way, the computational time is then reduced. Once, the kernel reaches the end of the thread, it start over at the next line until the end of the input image. It’s notable that the variance algorithm is closely related to the mean algorithm. 
&nbsp;In application, this algorithm works by using one “window” defined here by a circular kernel, which slides, entry by entry until the end of the signal. It can process through rows or columns.
This method is simple, moreover it’s characterised by low computational complexity compared to other methods (Cany, Sobel).
However it’s not devoid of weakness because of its low resistance to noise. Indeed the impulse and Gaussian noise significantly decreases quality of edge detection [^Fab2011].

### Choice of algorithm for webgl implementation

The naiv algorithm is used for computing the variance with the convolve and also for the webgl implementation. The main reason to use this algorithm is that it can be computed in one pass. The method with the convolve was implemented by JC Taveau, while I implemented an other method based on integral image[!cite  Grzegorz Sarwas
and Sławomir Skoneczny, Object Localization and Detection Using Variance Filter] these algorithms are running only with the CPU. However, the previous method is not that performant as described in the benchmark and it's rather difficult to implement it in webgl. Hence, the one pass algorithm was picked mainly for the performance and it's the same algorithm that in ImageJ.
