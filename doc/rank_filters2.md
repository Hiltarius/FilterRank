# Filters 2D (rank filters)
# 1.Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since image have been digitized on a computer's memory, it has been possible to interact in new ways with those images that were otherwise impossible. This is called image proccessing, and it consist of methods used to perform operations on a digital image. Those methods are described with various algorithms that can be used for various purposes in multiple fields. Those applications are used for noise filtering and other image enhancement as well as extracting information from images. In this project, will be examined the algorithms used for three types of 2D rank filters : median, min&max and variance.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;  By definition rank filters are non-linear filters using the local gray-level ordering to compute the filtered value[^Soi2002] . The output of the filter is the pixel value selected from a specified position in this ranked list. The ranked list is represented by all the grey values that lies within the window which are sorted, from the smallest to the highest value.
For an identical window the pixel value will differ in function of the filters used (median, min, max and variance). Moreover the size of the window is also influencing the output pixel. 
The median filter is so called because it's an operation which selects the median value.The median filter has been suggested by Tukey[^Tuk1974]. This filter is widely used for reducing certain type of noise and periodic interference patterns in signal and images without severly degrading the signal[^Hua1981].The naive algorithm was then improved based on the moving histogram technique[^Hua1979].
The filter that chooses the maximum or minimum values is called the maximum filter or the minimum filter. In discrete mathematical morphology, the minimum and maximum ranks play a key role since they correspond to the fundamental erosion and dilation operators[^Soi2002][^Wer1985]. Lastly the variance filter is used to edge detection. Edges can be detected using the 1st (Sobel or Cany approaches[^Can1986][^Kit1983]) or 2nd deriviates(Log approach[^Mar1980]) of the grey level intensity. Nevertheless there's other alternatives using synthetic and real images with the variance filter[^Fab2011]. As demonstrated here our three main filters have their own field of expertise. They can be used for removing noise (median filter), detecting edge (variance filter) and mathematical morphology(min/max filters). The main issues of these filters algorithm are their slowness, to overcome these problems the use of small windows and/or low resolution images is required[^Wei2006].


&nbsp;&nbsp;  In this report, we shall begin by describing the naive and improved algorithms of our 3 different filters. 
* Median filter
* Min/Max filter
* Variance filter

Next step will be to perform a benchmark on different imageJ plugins, with the objective of comparing their performances such as execution time and the memory load for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The ImageJ plugins compared are the default ImageJ RankFilters plugin which has implementation for the median, maximum, minimum and variance filters, and the FastFilters plugin, which contains implementation for the median maximum and minimum filters.  




# 2.Material & Methods

## Implementation of the median filter

The basic of a median filter is, for each pixel in an image, to center a WxH kernel on this pixel, and compute the median of the pixels in the kernel range, to create an output image with these computed median values.

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/alg_med_2.png)
![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/alg_med_3.png)

The first step of this median filter implementation is to extend the border of the image, so that that there is no undefined value in the kernel range for each pixel position of the original image. The new pixels created are given the value of the nearest pixel of the original image. To do that, the one dimensional array of pixels is transformed in a 2 dimensional one. The first element of each row is added a number equal to R (the radius of the kernel) to the start of this row, and the same is done at the end of the row using the last element of the list. Then the first row of the image is added R times at the start of the 2D image Array and the same is don with the last row at the end of the image array.

Considering an image of width X and height Y and a kernel of width W and height H, for each row y of the image, one array is created for each column x. Each of these array the value of the pixel of coordinate (x,y) as well as the next H-1 pixels in the column x. Then for each column x, the corresponding array as well as the next W-1 array are concatenated to obtain all the values that correspond to a certain position of the kernel. These values are sorted, and the median is retrieved for this position of the kernel. The process is then repeated for the column x+1 until all the median have been computed for the row, and this is repeated for the next y+1 row until reaching the end of the image.


### Attempted implementation of the Huang algoritm

The implementation of the median filter used here is a naive algorithm. Another implementation has been attempted that is base on the algorithm described by Huang [^Hua1979][^Hua1981].  This algorithm aim to reduce the number of times a sorting function is called as sorting is time consuming, but our implementation ended being even longer than the naive algorithm. While this algorithm is not in the final function provided, a benchmark analysis of this other  implementation has been done.

Considering an image of width X and height Y and a kernel of width W and height H, for each column of the image a 256 element array is created, with each element equal to 0 at the start, and those arrays are placed into an array Hist. Then for each pixels of coordinate (x,y) and value G of the first H rows of the image, Hist[y][G] increase by 1.

The median values for the pixels of the first row of the new image can then be computed from that array Hist. First, the median value for the first pixel in the row is computed by retrieving all the pixels values from the the first W arrays, and sorting them. The median Mdn is then the central element of the sorted array.

To compute the new median value for the pixel to the right, the following algorithm is used, using Mdn, the already computed median, Ltmdn, equal to the number of element in the sorted array that are strictly lower than Mdn, T equal to ((H*W-1)/2) with H and W the height and Width of the kernel, and Hist. Considering Y0 is the column of pixel that is no longer in the kernel, and Yn the new column that is now in the kernel :

	For each 0<=G<256
	if G < Mdn and Hist[Y0][G] > 0
	then do Ltmdn=Ltmdn-Hist[Y0][G].

	Then if G < Mdn and Hist[Yn][G] > 0
	do Ltmdn=Ltmdn+Hist[Yn][G]. 

	If Ltmdn > T
	do Mdn = Mdn-1 and Ltmdn=Ltmdn-(Hist[Y1][Mdn]+...+Hist[Yn][Mdn])
	until Ltmdn <= T.

	Else if Ltmdn <= T
	test Ltmdn+(Hist[Y1][Mdn]+...+Hist[Yn][Mdn]) <= T
	If true do Ltmdn = Ltmdn+(Hist[Y1][Mdn]+...+Hist[Yn][Mdn]) and Mdn=Mdn+1 and re-test
	If false Mdn is the median of the current kernel position.

This process is repeated for each pixels in the row. Then the arrays in Hist are updated for the next row, so that for each pixel of coordinate (X,Y) and of value G that is no more in the kernel Hist[Y][G] decrease by 1, and for each new pixel of coordinate (X,Y) and of value G in the kernel Hist[Y][G]. The the median values for the second row are computed in the same manner as the first, and this is repeated for all the rows of the original image.

## Implementation of the min/max filter

In the priveous report, we discussed about a min_max filter function whichs operate with consecutiv 1D filters, first in row then in colomns[^Gil1993]. In this report we describe the implementation of such a function.
Our algorithm is based on 2 differents things, first we take care of the edges with the addition of values on the edges depending on the filter(rows or coloms)so the last computation won't crop the image and seconds, the computation itself of the min or max values of the new padded image. Those operation'll be apply twice in a row in order to obtain a fully filtered image.
According to our Teacher Mr.Jean Cristophe Taveau demand, our implementation of the algorithm works on the images types 8-bit, 16-bit and float32. Our algorithm takes care of either min or max filters like the previeous algorithm suggested, and is fully operational on kernel with a size of either 3x3,5x5,7x7,9x9,11x11,13x13.

### Filling edges 
The first part of the algorithm is the _remplissage_ function which allow to obtain a padded image around the edges. This function can work either for the row filter or colomns filter with the paramater _type_. Depending of the type of the images and the filter filtre_ paramter we want to apply this function'll add extra values on the edges to help compute the min_max values of the image without interfering with the computations. The associated pseudo code is represented down below :
	
	if type == line
           for each colomn
              for each line+kernelsize/2
	    
	               if filtre = max 
		         	then do liste.push(-1)man outline black transparent background
			 
		       if filtre = min & type = uint8
				then do  liste.push(255)
			  
		       if filtre = min & type = uint16
		      		then do liste.push(65535)
			  
		        if filtre = min & type = float32
			  	then do liste.push(1)         
	      for each line 
	          do listepixel.push(pixel index)
		  do liste.splice(0,width,...listepixel)
	
       if type =column
	  if height <= width
	     if filter = min
	        while i < width*(width-height+kernelsize-1)
		    if type = uint8
		        do listepixels.push(255)
		    if type = uint16
		        do listepixels.push(65535)
		    if type = float
		        do listepixels.push(1)
		    if filter = max
		       while i < width*(width-height+kernelsize-1)
		       listepixels.push(-1)

### 1D Filters
The second and last part of the algorithm is to compute each row or each columns after the image is padded. Two function have been developped _filtreligne_ and the  _filtrecol_ functions respectively for the lines and columns.The functions works as follow, for the column function, it takes colmun after column, and for each pixel of each column it computes either the min or the max values according to the kernel size. The associated pseudo code for the column filter is down below : 

	for each column
	  for each line 
	     do liste.push(index values)
	       for each values in liste-kernelsize+1 
		    do finalimage.push(kernelsizefunction)


The same kind of operation applies for the line filter, the computation of the min or max function is then calculate with the _kernelsize_ function where the pseudo code is down below :
    
    	if filter = max 
		if kernel = 3
	  		do Math.max(image[i],image2[i+1],image[i+2]
		if kernel = 5 
	  		do Math.max(image[i],image[i+1],image[i+2],image[i+3],image[i+4])
		...
		...

	if filter = min 
		if kernel = 3
	  		do Math.min(image[i],image2[i+1],image[i+2]
		if kernel = 5 
	  		do Math.min(image[i],image[i+1],image[i+2],image[i+3],image[i+4])
		...
		...
For the line filter we do not need to apply any other transformations in our image but for the column filter we need to transpose the final filtered image because by pushing our values we rotated the values in the array, finally we apply a function on this array that will makes the two Dimensional array into one. 
The _min_max function is the main function where the whole process is applied(rows padding into line filtering into columns padding with finally column filtering).

## Implementation of the variance filter
Globally the variance function is subdivised in four part, the first part consist to compute the integral of two images for one the sum of all the pixels values and for the other the sum of all squared pixels values. Then treating the bundaries issues by adding black pixels at the edges of the image. Thirdly, get the four coordinates for each pixels in order to compute the sum of value of pixels in the rectangular region. Finally, compute the variance by substracting the values obtained through the precendent formula for the second image (squared) divised by the size of the kernel (h*w) with the square values obtained from the first image divised by the size of the kernel squared.

### implementation and pseudo-code for the integral image

The Integral Image is used as a quick and effective way of calculating the sum of values (pixel values) in a given image ‚Äì or a rectangular subset of a grid[^SHI2017].
The method for variance filtering make use of a faster algorithm to compute the variance of the pixels in a window[^Vio2001][^Sar2015]. From a starting image I, compute an image I' for which the pixel I'(x,y) take as value the sum of all pixels values in the original image between I(0,0) and I(x,y) included [Fig. 2].


![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/var_integ1.png)
#### Fig 2. An example of the area pixels between I(0,0) and I(x,y) included. 

Afterwards compute an image I'' for which the pixel I''(x,y) take as value the sum of all squared pixels values in the original image between I(0,0) and I(x,y) included. Here is an example[Fig. 3] of what the function should do for both input images.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/var_matrix_3.png)  
#### Fig 3. An exemple of a image I and the new computed image I' and I''. 

The implementation of this algorithm was first describe by [^BRA2007] with the following pseudo code.

	for i=0 to w do
   	sum‚Üê0
   	  for j=0 to h do
   	    sum ‚Üê sum + in[i, j]	  
            if i = 0 then
              intImg[i, j] ‚Üê sum	   
            else	 
              intImg[i, j] ‚Üê intImg[i ‚àí 1, j] + sum
            end if
   	  end for 
	end for
	    
Integral image was first implemented by using nested for loops, it was then transformed in functional programming by following the ECMAScript6 syntax with first the uses of two forEach after having transform the width and the height in index with the use of map represented below this method is simply based on the previous pseudo code.


  	  let firstintegral = width.forEach(x =>{
	  sum = 0;
	  height.forEach(y =>{
	    sum += pixels[x + y*w];
	    (x==0) ? output.pixelData[x+y*w] = sum:output.pixelData[x+y*w] = output.pixelData[(x-1)+y*w] + sum;
	    
Afterwards a better functional method was proposed by J.C Taveau using a reduce with the use of an accumulator in order to compute the summed-area table, this method is used in the implementation of the variance filter. This method act like the Smith-Waterman algorithm[Fig. x] using the accumulator for a size equal to the width and the previous computed integral to compute the integral. 

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/Smith-Waterman-Algorithm-Scoring-2.png)
#### Fig x. Simplified Smith‚ÄìWaterman algorithm when linear gap penalty function is used

The main advantages of this method is that it is 100% functional whereas the previous method even if faster was not totally functional because of the two forEach moreover it uses less characters than the other method (207 characters against 336 characters). However this method has also some disadvantages caused by the accumulator that cost as an extra row and forEach is way more faster than reduce (depending on the web-browser). All of these methods are still provided in the variance filter script.

### Implementation of the padding and currying computational.

The image is firstly transformed from a 1d array to a 2d array. In the aim of treating the borders, we defined a constant ker obtained by the following formula:

	With k = kernel
	ker = ((k-1)/2) *2

The resulting number will give to the _padding_ function the number of rows and columns that has to be added. For a kernel ("Window") of diameter 2 and 3 it will respectively padd the image of 1 black pixel or 2 black pixels. This constant is specified to our main algorithm when convolving. Indeed the first computed pixel is not the central pixel here but the first pixel in the kernel. The _padding_ function is mainly using function concat with one map to realize the padding. This method act as a curried function because it's not returning the padding with a matrix pixels of different size compare to the original input. It takes a function _padding_ whose return value is another function _getCoord_. The final result is automatically transform in 1D without the uses of any particular method. 

This method act as following:

	img_returned = liste	
	for x= k-1 to h+(k-2) do
	  for y= k-1 to w+(k-2) do     		  
	    if img[x-1][y-1] = 0 and img[x+k-1][y-1] = 0 or
	    img[x+k-1][y+k-1] = 0 and img[x+k-1][y-1] = 0 and img[x+k-1][y+k-1] = 0 or
	    img[x-1][y-1] = 0 and img[x-1][y+k-1] = 0 or
	    img[x+k-1][y+k-1] = 0 && img[x-1][y+k-1] = 0 then 
	      img_returned = 0	   
	    else	
	      A = img[x-1][y-1]
	      B = img[x+k-1][y-1]
	      C = img[x-1][y+k-1]
	      D = img[x+k-1][y+k-1]
	      I = A-B-C+D
	      img_returned = I
	    end if
	  end for 
	end for

In this method the borders are treated with 4 ternary condition. The first if condition treat all the left values, while the second,third and last condition are treating respetively down, up and right borders. In order to avoid black pixel in the output we're using the available crop method in the times API.

For a better understanding of this pseudo code here an example of how it is working[Fig. 4.]

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/var_coord1.png)  
#### Fig 4. The four shaded coordinates are used in order to compute the sum of the delineated rectangular (kernel) region whith A,B,C and D respectively represented by the top left, down left, top right and down right shaded locations, M represented by the diameter of the kernel, W and H by the width and the height of the array and finally yc and xc is the treated pixel by A,B,C and D. 

### Implementation of the Variancefilter() function.

The last function _getvar_ takes the return of the previous function and compute the formula[Fig. 5] and repeat it for each window. _getvar_ method requires two images as parameter in order to compute this equation with the square kernel. Moreover our function considers each type of image (8bit, 16bit and float32) and convert the aberant values to the adaptated type. The threshold value for aberrant values is purely arbitrary. We consider that for a threshold of 10000000 the values beneath the threshold are set to 0 whereas the upper values are set to the maximum (256*256). For the type Float 32 the values remains between 0 and 1. This funcion is 100% functionnal using two map for iterate through the image and compute the variance value for each pixels.

![EqVar2_3](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/EqVar2_3.gif)
#### Fig 5. Where n is the kernel diameter, I" corresponds to the sum of value of pixels in the rectangular region for the squared image and I' sum of value of pixels in the rectangular region.

This formula allows us to compute  the variance of rectangular patch of image. The associated pseudo code is represented down below :

	for x=0 to w do
	  for y=0 to h do 
	    result = (I"[x +y*w]/(kernel*kernel)) - (I'[x+y*w]/(kernel)* I'[x+y*w]/(kernel))
	    if result > 255 and type = 8bit then
	      var = 255	 
	    else
	      var = 0
	    else if result < 10000000 and type = 16bit then 
	      var = 0
	    else  
	      var = 65535
	    else if result > 1 and type = float32 then
	      var = 1
	    else
	      var = result
	    end if
	  end for 
	end for
	

Finally _getvar_ function is called in the main function _variance_ with one _padding_ taking as first argument the sum of all pixels values in the original image and a second argument _padding_ taking as first argument the sum of all squared pixels values in the original image. The return raster is then cropped according to the size of the kernel in the aim of avoiding black bars in the output image.


## Benchmarking analysis
Benchmarking analysis is a method widely used to assess the relative performance of an object[^Fle1896]. That way, it's possible to compare the performance of various algorithms. Only execution time and memory load will be analysed here. In order to perform this benchmark, two scripts were implemented. The first script, named *benchmark2* whose aim is to compute the time speed between the start and the end of an input image coming from ImageJ during the filtering process. This script was implemented using the ImageJ macro language. The second script *memoryall.js* was implemented in javascript, to measure the memory used by the JVM while running the filter in ImageJ until the end of the process. 
The operation process is ran 1100 times for both measurements to provide robust data. In order to not recording false values we're not considering the first 100 values. Indeed during the execution, we must take into account the internal allocations of the loading images which may introduce error in our measurement.

For this project the benchmark was performed with the operating system Linux (4.9.0-3-amd64)  using the 1.8.0_144 version of Java and running with the 1.51q version of ImageJ. The model image of this benchmark is Lena for various pixels size.

## Image results

### Median filter

The Fig X. show the results obtained using our median filter implementation compared to the ImageJ implementation. While the images X. B and C aren't easily distinguishable to the naked eye, the image D shows that there ise some difference in pixel value at the border inside the image. This is probably caused by the difference of the shape of the kernels used in the algorithms : square for our implmentation and circle for ImageJ.

## Benchmark comparison between ImageJ and our implementation


### Median filter

A comparative benchmark for our own median filter against the median filter from ImageJ has been done with a set of 21 images between seven different resolution¬†:  180x144, 360x288, 540x432, 720x576, 900x720, 1080x864, and 1440x1152. Each set of 3 images have the same resolution but are of a different type, either 8-bit ,16-bit or float32 (or 32-bit for ImageJ). Additionally a benchmark analysis has also been done on the attempted implementation of the Huang algorithm only for 8-bit images. The benchmark results is represented down below :

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/MedianPerso_Rplot.png)
#### Fig. X Execution time benchmark analysis for the implemented median algorithm for a kernel of size 5x5.

The execution time of the algorithm increase exponentially has the resolution of the image increase. Up until the 720x576 pixels image there is not a noticeable difference in time between the 8-bit, 16-bit and float 32 execution time, while for higher resolution image the 8-bit image become slightly faster. Only the 180x144 pixels image as an execution time below 1s, and the image bigger than the 720x576 have an execution time of more than 10s.

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/MedianAltAlgo_Rplot.png)
#### Fig. X Execution time benchmark analysis for an alternative algorithm for a kernel of size 5x5.

The execution time for the attempted implementation increase even more rapidly than the basic implementation. The execution time is always longer than 1s, and the 1080x864 and  1440x1152 pixels images have a more than1minute execution time.

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/Median_ImageJRplot.png)
#### Fig. X Execution time benchmark analysis for the ImageJ median algorithm for a kernel of radius 2.

The ImageJ algorithm execution time also increase exponentially. The difference in execution time between the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit is noticeable and increase with time with 8-bit the fastest and 32-bit the slowest.

### Min-Max filter
A comparative benchmark of 50 iterations for our own  Min/Max filter against the Min/Max filter from imageJ has been done with a set of 24 images bewteen eight different resolution 180x144, 360x288, 540x432, 720x576, 900x720, 1080x864, 1440x1152, and 1880x1440. Each set of 3 images have the same resolution but with a different type, either 8bit,16bit or float32. The benchmark representation is represented down below :

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/myRplot3.png)
#### Fig 7. Execution time benchmark analysis against the implemented min_max algorithm for a kernel size = 3, filter = max. 
On the figure 7, the execution time for either 8bit,16bit or float32 for an image with the same resolution does not change significantly on either resolution, infact the 3 lines which represent the execution time are close together. For the first 5 resolutions we can see an increase of the execution time from 80ms in general up to 8000 ms. At a resolution of 1440x1140 and higher the line follows an exponential pattern, this is where we find our algorithm limit. Finally our algorithm has the same performance for either 8bit,16bit or float32.

#### Fig 8. Execution time benchmark analysis against the min_max algorithm of ImageJ for a kernel size = 3, filter = max. 
On the figure 8, the execution time from the first resolution to the sixth doesnt change really, also the scale of the benchamrk isnt the same, in fact the imageJ algorithm is way much more efficient than our own implementation. For the first image with a resolution of 180x144 our algorithm takes 50ms to complete the process unlike imageJ algorithm which takes 12ms. When we use the algorithm on all the upsizing images ImageJ algorithm execution time doesn't go higher than 38ms when on the contrary our own algorithm goes until 166067ms for the 1880x1440 resolution. We also see that the imageJ algorithm execution time doesn't change with images of different types, same as our own algorithm.

### Variance filter

A comparative benchmark for our own  Variance filter against the Variance filter from imageJ has been done with a set of 24 images bewteen seven different resolution  360x288, 720x576, 900x720, 1080x864, 1440x1152, 1880x1440 and 2880x2304. Each set of 3 images have the same resolution but with a different type, either 8bit, 16bit or float32. The benchmark representation is represented down below :

#### Fig 9. Execution time benchmark analysis against the implemented min_max algorithm for a kernel size = 3, filter = Variance. 
On the figure 9, the execution time for either 8bit,16bit or float32 for an image with the same resolution does not change significantly on either resolution, infact the 3 lines which represent the execution time are close together. For the first 6 resolutions we can see an increase of the execution time from 50ms in general up to 4500 ms. At a resolution of 1880x1440 and higher the line follows an exponential pattern, this is where we find our algorithm limit. Finally our algorithm has the same performance for either 8bit,16bit or float32.

#### Fig 10. Execution time benchmark analysis against the min_max algorithm of ImageJ for a kernel size = 3, filter = Variance. 
On the figure 10, the execution time from the first resolution to the sixth doesnt change really, also the scale of the benchamrk isnt the same, in fact the imageJ algorithm is way much more efficient than our own implementation. For the first image with a resolution of 360x288 our algorithm takes 50ms to complete the process unlike imageJ algorithm which takes 1.398ms. When we use the algorithm on all the upsizing images ImageJ algorithm execution time doesn't go higher than 80ms for either 16bit or 32bit when on the contrary our own algorithm goes until 20000ms for the 2880x2304 resolution. We also see that the variance imageJ algorithm execution time change between images types. Indeed it takes around 80ms for 16 bit and 32bit against 45ms for 8bit, it's two times faster for filtering an 8bit image compared to 16bit and 32bit whereas there's no particular changes for our function. Moreover 8bit filter is way more faster than for the two other types mainly because of the low complexity values [0...256].

# 4.Discussion
## Overall quality comparison between imageJ and our algorithms
 For the median filter ..
 For the min_max filter we do obtain the same results than the imageJ functions, with a same kernelsize even if the processing is different the output remains the same for any tipe of kernel or type of images.
 
For the variance filter we obtained the same results as presented in the previous part. Developing this script in ECMAScript 6 tends to gain in term of visibility comparing to the java plugin with nested loops and conditional statements. However it's not totally functional the _Getcoord_ function was not written in functional mainly because the iteration is starting and ending for various size depending on the padding. Moreover _padding_ function add extra rows for the upper and left part of the pixel-matrix.

## Overall performance comparison between imageJ and our algorithms
 For the median filter ..
 For the min_max filter the execution time of imageJ compared to our algorithm is better for any resolution, altought many variables have to be take into account, first the algorithms were running of mozilla Firefox web-browser which may lead to slowness for long computations. As well, with more optimization our algorithm could be easily faster because of the presence of many loops that may be reduced. 
 
 For the variance filter the execution time of ImageJ compared to our algorithm is way more better due to the fact that the algorithms are not similar. Indeed, ImageJ plugin is using convolve function to compute the variance and the mean. Moreover for loops are way more faster than map, reduce or forEach. As said before the benchmark may not be that relevant caused by the web-browser (Firefox) used to perform the benchmark if the version is not up to date. Another explanation for the slowness of our algorithm can be related to the number of times that we iterate through our image. Indeed the _convolve_ function of ImageJ iterates only one time through the image pixels whereas our algorithm has to iterate multiple times multiply. Hence, the complexity will not be the same between both algorithms
 
# 5.Conclusion

From the results of the benchmark tests it can be concluded that the median filter .... The minimum and maximum filters can be treated with the same functions but unlike the default implementation in ImageJ the execution time is too slow for high resolution images, however we did try to functionalize as much as we could, and curried our functions delivering a fonctional algorithm which work with 8 bit,16bit and float32 images.Finally the _min_max_ algorithm respects the process of 1D filter after 1D filter described in the first markdown.


Functional programming is a programming paradigm that'll allow us to process in parallel ...
