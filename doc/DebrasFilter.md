# 1.Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since image have been digitized on a computer's memory, it has been possible to interact in new ways with those images that were otherwise impossible. This is called image proccessing, and it consist of methods used to perform operations on a digital image. Those methods are described with various algorithms that can be used for various purposes in multiple fields. Those applications are used for noise filtering and other image enhancement as well as extracting information from images. In this project, will be examined the algorithms used for three types of 2D rank filters : minimum and maximum. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  By definition rank filters are non-linear filters using the local gray-level ordering to compute the filtered value[^Soi2002] . The output of the filter is the pixel value selected from a specified position in this ranked list. The ranked list is represented by all the grey values that lies within the window which are sorted, from the smallest to the highest value.
For an identical window the pixel value will differ in function of the filters used (median, min, max and variance). Moreover the size of the window is also influencing the output pixel. 
The filter that chooses the maximum or minimum values is called the maximum filter or the minimum filter. In discrete mathematical morphology, the minimum and maximum ranks play a key role since they correspond to the fundamental erosion and dilation operators[^Soi2002][^Wer1985]. Lastly the variance filter is used to edge detection. Edges can be detected using the 1st (Sobel or Cany approaches[^Can1986][^Kit1983]) or 2nd deriviates(Log approach[^Mar1980]) of the grey level intensity. Nevertheless there's other alternatives using synthetic and real images with the variance filter[^Fab2011]. As demonstrated here our three main filters have their own field of expertise. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;  In this report, we shall begin by describing the implementation of ouralgorithm in GPU mode of our 2 different filters. 

* Min/Max filter


Next step will be to perform a benchmark on different imageJ plugins, with the objective of comparing their performances such as execution time and the memory load for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The ImageJ plugins compared are the default ImageJ RankFilters plugin which has implementation for maximum and minimum  filters and the FastFilters plugin, which contains implementation for the maximum and minimum filters.

## Benchmarking analysis
Benchmarking analysis is a method widely used to assess the relative performance of an object[^Fle1896]. That way, it's possible to compare the performance of various algorithms. Only execution time and memory load will be analysed here. In order to perform this benchmark, one script was implemented. The first script, named *benchmark2* whose aim is to compute the time speed between the start and the end of an input image coming from ImageJ during the filtering process. This script was implemented using the ImageJ macro language. 
The operation process is run 1000 times for ImageJ measurements to provide robust data. In order to not recording false values we're not considering the first 100 values. Indeed during the execution, we must take into account the internal allocations of the loading images which may introduce error in our measurement. For our own algorithm we did only 50 iterations because of the amount of time that each algorithm takes.

For this project the benchmark was performed with the operating system Linux (4.9.0-3-amd64)  using the 1.8.0_144 version of Java and running with the 1.51q version of ImageJ. The model image of this benchmark is Lena for various pixels size.

## Image results

### Median filter

The Fig 7. show the results obtained using our median filter implementation compared to the ImageJ implementation. While the images 7. B and C aren't easily distinguishable to the naked eye, the image D shows that there ise some difference in pixel value at the border inside the image.

### Min/Max filter

#### Fig 8. (A) Original image, (B) image obtained using ImageJ maximum filter (kernel radius equal 1), (C) image obtained using our implementation (3x3 kernel) and (D) difference between B and C.
This figure represents in A the default image (boats 720x576-8bit), B the result of the max filter in imageJ with a radius of 1, C the result of our own function with a kernel size of 3, D the difference between the imageJ and our own filter. Because of the different kind of kernel shapes, we do obtain a slighty difference between the imageJ output and our own which is represented in the figure D.
### Variance filter

The following figure shows the result of our _variance_ function for a boat of 720x576 pixels taking as parameter a kernel of diameter = 2 compared to the variance filter of ImageJ with a kernel radius =0.5. The results are different for mainly two reasons one is that the luminosity between B and C are different and the fact that the kernel on ImageJ is circular whereas our kernel is square.

## Benchmark comparison between ImageJ and our implementation



### Min-Max filter
A comparative benchmark of 50 iterations for our own  Min/Max filter against the Min/Max filter from imageJ has been done with a set of 24 images bewteen eight different resolution 180x144, 360x288, 540x432, 720x576, 900x720, 1080x864, 1440x1152, and 1880x1440. Each set of 3 images have the same resolution but with a different type, either 8bit,16bit or float32. The benchmark representation is represented down below :

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/myRplot3.png)
#### Fig 13. Execution time benchmark analysis against the implemented min_max algorithm for a kernel size = 3, filter = max. 
On the figure 13, the execution time for either 8bit,16bit or float32 for an image with the same resolution does not change significantly on either resolution, infact the 3 lines which represent the execution time are close together. For the first 5 resolutions we can see an increase of the execution time from 80ms in general up to 8000 ms. At a resolution of 1440x1140 and higher the line follows an exponential pattern, this is where we find our algorithm limit. Finally our algorithm has the same performance for either 8bit,16bit or float32.

![](https://github.com/fsoubes/FilterRank/blob/master/images/imageJplot3.png) 
#### Fig 14. Execution time benchmark analysis against the min_max algorithm of ImageJ for a kernel size = 3, filter = max. 
On the figure 14, the execution time from the first resolution to the sixth doesnt change really, also the scale of the benchamrk isnt the same, in fact the imageJ algorithm is way much more efficient than our own implementation. For the first image with a resolution of 180x144 our algorithm takes 50ms to complete the process unlike imageJ algorithm which takes 12ms. When we use the algorithm on all the upsizing images ImageJ algorithm execution time doesn't go higher than 38ms when on the contrary our own algorithm goes until 166067ms for the 1880x1440 resolution. We also see that the imageJ algorithm execution time doesn't change with images of different types, same as our own algorithm.



# 4.Discussion
## Overall quality comparison between imageJ and our algorithms

For the median filter, slight difference on all the internal border are visible. These differences might be explained by the use of a square kernel in our implementation of the algorithm while the kernel used in ImageJ as a circular shape. The differences would most likely increase with the size of the kernel, because more pixels included in our kernel would not be included in ImageJ kernel.

 For the min_max filter we almost obtain the same results than the imageJ functions, with a same kernel size even if the processing is different the output remains almost the same for any type of kernel or type of images.
 
For the variance filter we obtained the same results as presented in the previous part. Developing this script in ECMAScript 6 tends to gain in term of visibility comparing to the java plugin with nested loops and conditional statements. However it's not totally functional the _Getcoord_ function was not written in functional mainly because the iteration is starting and ending for various size depending on the padding. Moreover _padding_ function add extra rows for the upper and left part of the pixel-matrix. In order to avoid black pixel in the output we're using the available crop method in the times API that process is not included in the main function _variance_.

## Overall performance comparison between imageJ and our algorithms

Our implementation of the median filter is extremely time consuming, with a difference of more than three orders of magnitude of differences on the 900x720 pixels image and the bigger ones. Even for the 180x144 image the difference is more than two order of magnitude longer then the imageJ. These differences, are most likely explained by the algorithm used as well as a lack of optimization of that algorithm, most likely in the gestion of the array, as for each pixel of the image the algorithm iterate on multiple algorithm. On top of that, the use of the sort function is time consuming.

It should be noted that the implementation of the Huang algorithm ended even more time consuming on the images tested. For the smallest image there is a difference of more than one order of magnitude between our 2 tested implementation for 8 b-it images (152ms to 1865ms) while the difference for the biggest image is less than one order of magnitude (70092ms to 138534ms). While our implementation of the Huang algorithm is much slower for normal sized image, it might be faster then our naive implementation for very big image. The padding also has a high cost in time. If the function did not implement the padding the output image would be smaller which might not be very inconveniant for a single use of the filter, but if the function is part of a pipeline of multiple function each not extending the border the image would end noticeably smaller than the input image which is not desirable.
 
 For the min_max filter the execution time of imageJ compared to our algorithm is better for any resolution, altought many variables have to be take into account, first the algorithms were running on mozilla Firefox web-browser which may lead to slowness for long computations. As well, with more optimization our algorithm could be easily faster because of the presence of many loops that may be reduced. Also imageJ algorithm only iterate once through the image pixels unlike our algorithm which has four big steps.
 
 For the variance filter the execution time of ImageJ compared to our algorithm is way more better due to the fact that the algorithms are not similar. Indeed, ImageJ plugin is using convolve function to compute the variance and the mean. Moreover for loops are way more faster than map, reduce or forEach. As said before the benchmark may not be that relevant caused by the web-browser (Firefox) used to perform the benchmark if the version is not up to date. Another explanation for the slowness of our algorithm can be related to the number of times that we iterate through our image. Indeed the _convolve_ function of ImageJ iterates only one time through the image pixels whereas our algorithm has to iterate multiple times multiply. Hence, the complexity will not be the same between both algorithms
 
# 5.Conclusion
In general, the execution time of every algorithm implemented are slower than the ImageJ  especially for high resolution images. The min_max and median algorithm have higher exexution time than the variance algorithm, however we do obtain close results for the similarity of the output images for each algorithm.
For each algorithm we did try to functionalize as much as we could, and curried our functions delivering  fonctional algorithms which work with 8 bit,16bit and float32 images
Finally the different algorithms respect what was developped in the first markdown for instance the min_max algorithm respects the process of 1D filter after 1D filter described in the first markdown, and the variance algorithm respects the algorithm proposed to calculate the variance of an image. On the other hand, the median filter has been implemented using a naive algorithm because the attempted implementation of the Huang algorithm ended more time consuming.
